# Monetization: Turning Infrastructure into Revenue

## 1. Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS)

We do not sell "database access"; we sell **Risk Mitigation**.

* **The "Draw" Fee:** Charge a micro-fee ($1-$5) for every "Disbursement" processed. The value prop is the **Automatic Lien Waiver Generation** and **UCC Article 12 Finality**.
* **Mechanism:** `api-pakana` checks the Organization's credit balance before signing a Codex Entry.

## 2. Infrastructure Licensing

* **Target:** Construction firms and Developers who want data sovereignty.
* **Model:** Monthly subscription ($50-$200/mo) to license the "Pakana Node" software container. They pay their own Azure costs; we charge for the software capability.
* **Payment Rails:** Accept USDC (via Stellar) or Fiat (via Stripe/PayPal).

## 3. Verification API

* **Target:** Banks, Insurance, Auditors.
* **Model:** "Pay-per-verify." Third parties pay to audit the chain of custody for a specific asset without needing the owner's direct intervention.
